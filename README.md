# LocustsBuhl2006
Simulation of Model in "From Disorder to Order in Marching Locusts" Buhl et al. Science 2006

Simulate Vicksek model of locust movement. Created for MCSB Journal Club, Feb 2020.

Add animation of moving locusts, to show how locusts respond to their neighbors in the model.

Based on discussion in class, added heterogenaity to the locusts. Created some "defectors" which don't respond to the presenece of other locusts. We find that adding these defectors raises the critical dentisy at which switching behavior occurs.
